# Control_Motor_Speed_Simulink
Adjust the motor speed by modulating the PWM duty cycle in response to varying input voltages ranging from 0 to 5 V. Implement this control system using MATLAB Simulink with external mode.

# Technical Features:-
## The input voltage between 0 to 1V --> the motor speed 10% from rated speed (Duty=10%)
### The input voltage between 1 to 2V --> the motor speed 10% from rated speed (Duty=20%)
#### The input voltage between 2 to 3V --> the motor speed 10% from rated speed (Duty=50%)
##### The input voltage between 3 to 4V --> the motor speed 10% from rated speed (Duty=70%)
###### The input voltage between 4 to 5V --> the motor speed 10% from rated speed (Duty=90%)

# System Components:
## The system includes:
1) Arduino ATmega2560: Reads the potentiometer value and produces PWM signals at a 200 kHz frequency. The duty cycle of the PWM is determined by the input from the potentiometer.
2)Potentiometer: Adjusts the voltage input.
3) Oscilloscope: Displays the output PWM waveform.
